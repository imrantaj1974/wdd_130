<h2>Imran Taj</h2>
<p>My name is Imran Taj. I am married to Safia, and we have three children starting with eldest Gabriel, Michael and Marian.  We live in Lahore, Pakistan.  I am currently working as Coordinator for seminary and Institute of religion for Pakistan.  </p>
<p>I completed my graduation in Computer Science but studying in BYU is a great experience.  It has a life changing experience; it not only helps me get worldly knowledge but also the spiritual knowledge.  I love to read, watch movies, and play badminton and table tennis.  I served in church at different positions. I served as counselor in district, as a branch president and district president. Church Employment and leadership has a transforming effect in my life. I owe everything to church for what I have achieved in my life.</p>
<p>I love to help in need especially in education. I know that through education and knowledge we may know better about our creator (Heavenly Father) and our Savior Jesus Christ and our purpose here in this world. Education opens the gates of progress and happiness. Through Education we can overcome so many obstacles and get real enlightenment.</p>
